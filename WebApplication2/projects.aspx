            <h1>MR2, the joy the pain!!</h1>
            <p>After haring a slight screech getting onto the freeway the mr2 would not build boost! </p>
            <p> I had been in the process of swapping out the waste gate actuator. So at first I suspected the actuator.</p>
            <p>Had become disconnected. After further investigation I found that my ct20b turbo had finally failed.</p>
            <p>Amazingly I had actually gotten lucky. Only the hot side of the turbo had failed. </p>
            <p>So no shards of metal were ingested by the engine. Time to replace it!</p>
